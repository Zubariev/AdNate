1. wipe 3 concepts from Brief page once briefs.image_generation_status == "completed".

2. fix timeout issue on Brief page while brief enhancement proces and 3 concepts creation. 
Possible resolve: redirect user to the Loading page untill these process have been done.

3. redirect user to an editor page after briefs.image_generation_status == "completed".

4. place elemnts images on the canvas at editor page the user has been redirected. 

5. count LLM input tockens limits, create tocken limits for prompts. 

6. check if the background is REALLY transparent for elements generated: 
did I stored the same unprocessed (backgroud removal) image?

7. clean up unused files (e.g. huggingface.tsx). fix relations to these files.
