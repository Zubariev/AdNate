# TODO List, Bugs, and Potential Vulnerabilities

## Critical Issues

### 1. Route Inconsistencies
- **Mixed Router Implementation**: `routes.tsx` defines routes array but also has an unused `AppRoutes` component with `BrowserRouter`
- **Duplicate Router Setup**: Router is created in `App.tsx` but `routes.tsx` has its own routing logic
- **Route Configuration Mismatch**: The routes array is used in `App.tsx` but the `AppRoutes` component in `routes.tsx` is not utilized

### 2. File Structure Problems
- **Duplicate Package.json**: Both root and `config/` folder have package.json files with different dependencies
- **Configuration Scattered**: Config files exist in both root and `config/` folder
- **Mixed File Extensions**: `DesignEditor.jsx` is the only .jsx file in a TypeScript project

### 3. Authentication Vulnerabilities
- **Client-Side Auth State**: Authentication state is managed client-side with localStorage
- **No Auth Guards**: Routes are not properly protected - users can access `/designs` and `/editor` without authentication
- **Auth Provider Issues**: `AuthProvider` wraps routes but authentication logic is duplicated in `LandingPage.tsx`
- **Session Validation**: No proper session validation on route changes

## Security Vulnerabilities

### 1. Data Exposure
- **Environment Variables**: `.env` file present but contents unknown - potential for exposed secrets
- **Supabase Keys**: Client-side Supabase configuration may expose sensitive keys
- **No Input Validation**: Missing validation for user inputs in design editor and blog components

### 2. XSS and Injection Risks
- **HTML Content**: Blog posts and design elements may allow unsafe HTML injection
- **Image Upload**: `ImageGenerator` component with AI integration lacks proper validation
- **Canvas Manipulation**: Design editor allows arbitrary content without sanitization

### 3. CORS and API Security
- **External API Calls**: Hugging Face integration without proper API key management
- **Supabase RLS**: No evidence of Row Level Security policies implementation

## Performance Issues

### 1. Bundle Size
- **Large UI Library**: 40+ shadcn/ui components loaded (many likely unused)
- **Heavy Dependencies**: html2canvas and other libraries increase bundle size
- **No Code Splitting**: No evidence of route-based code splitting

### 2. State Management
- **Props Drilling**: No global state management for design editor state
- **Unnecessary Re-renders**: Missing React optimization patterns (memo, useMemo, useCallback)

## Functional Bugs

### 1. Design Editor Issues
- **Canvas State**: No proper state persistence for design editor
- **Layer Management**: Layer panel implementation incomplete
- **Export Functionality**: html2canvas integration may have cross-browser issues
- **Responsive Design**: Canvas may not work properly on mobile devices

### 2. Blog System Bugs
- **Static Data**: Blog posts are hardcoded in `data/blog-posts.ts` instead of database-driven
- **Comment System**: Comment section component exists but no backend integration
- **Search/Filter**: Category filtering implementation incomplete

### 3. Navigation Issues
- **404 Handling**: Generic NotFound component but no proper error boundaries
- **Back Button**: No proper browser history management in design editor
- **Deep Linking**: Design editor state not reflected in URLs

## Missing Features/TODOs

### 1. Core Functionality
- [ ] Complete design editor save/load functionality
- [ ] Implement proper user design storage in Supabase
- [ ] Add design sharing and collaboration features
- [ ] Implement blog post creation/editing interface
- [ ] Add user profile management

### 2. Security Enhancements
- [ ] Implement proper authentication guards
- [ ] Add input validation and sanitization
- [ ] Set up Supabase Row Level Security policies
- [ ] Implement CSRF protection
- [ ] Add rate limiting for API calls

### 3. Performance Optimizations
- [ ] Implement code splitting for routes
- [ ] Add lazy loading for components
- [ ] Optimize bundle size by removing unused dependencies
- [ ] Add proper error boundaries
- [ ] Implement proper loading states

### 4. UX Improvements
- [ ] Add proper mobile responsiveness
- [ ] Implement keyboard shortcuts for design editor
- [ ] Add undo/redo functionality
- [ ] Improve design templates and gallery
- [ ] Add search functionality for designs and blogs

### 5. DevOps and Deployment
- [ ] Clean up duplicate configuration files
- [ ] Implement proper environment management
- [ ] Add proper error logging and monitoring
- [ ] Set up automated testing
- [ ] Configure proper CI/CD pipeline

## Immediate Actions Needed

1. **Fix Route Configuration**: Consolidate routing logic in one place
2. **Clean Up File Structure**: Remove duplicate configs and standardize file extensions
3. **Implement Auth Guards**: Protect routes that require authentication
4. **Add Input Validation**: Sanitize all user inputs
5. **Database Integration**: Connect blog system to Supabase instead of static data
6. **Security Audit**: Review all API integrations and implement proper security measures

## Testing Requirements
- [ ] Unit tests for all components
- [ ] Integration tests for authentication flow
- [ ] E2E tests for design editor functionality
- [ ] Security testing for XSS and injection vulnerabilities
- [ ] Performance testing for large designs and blog content
